# Inspiration for iKoolCore R1

Hi, I am Jackeroo, a Paid Ads Specialist for E-commerce client in China before Jan, 2021. How and why I decided to create a new hardware device called iKoolCore R1 and how R1 can do for me? There're the reasons: 

1. As  a ads  specialist, I need visit Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. frequently in daily work. But there is a great network blocker named GFW lead by Chinese government.  I need to go through GFW to do my work  on Facebook Ads manager, google ads manager and Pinterest ads manager. So a device that can be running SSR, V2ray, Trojan etc. is a necessary for me;
2. There're lots of pfsense boxes(You guys call it miniPCs with multi-NICs, but we call it "工控机") in the market, but they all in a industrial style, sometime with ugly case and design but higher price, what will users choose if I design a new device smaller with user-friendly look and higher performance ?
3. Many Chinese potential customers need this equipment, especially coders. With this x86 mini PC, they can deploy a PVE server or ESXi server at home. Thousands of docker images on dockerhub will make it easier for them to practice skills and daily life;
4. Based on the relationship with the PM from a hardware factory that can design and produce mini PCs. I told him about my thought, and got a  positive response in Dec 2021.

All in all, iKoolCore R1 is a personal project designed by Jackeroo according to his own interests and needs. And R1 can solve the needs of many potential customers in their daily technological life.
